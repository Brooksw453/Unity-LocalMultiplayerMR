# Colocation Package

To enable Local Multiplayer the following is needed

- **Matchmaking** - Finding Players to play with
- **Player Connection**  - Players joining the same game to play in
- **Colocation** - Players can see the same object in the same position

Colocation Package provides network agnostic interfaces to enable colocation in Mixed Reality using Unity. Colocation Package does this by implementing the core logic of Shared Spatial Anchors.
